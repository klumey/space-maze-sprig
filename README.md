# Space maze using Sprig /Still WIP!!
game available on: sprig.hackclub.com/share/laElSchGPrkd5g4tUZL2

During the process of creating this game, I learnt a lot of new things. It is my first time coding in JS, and I'm no programming expert (only used to code some algorithms in C++).
Making all of this has been and will be a lot of fun and a great experience for me. 
All images/sprites used are made fully by me! 
To be honest, I'm really happy with the outcome and excited to call it mine. Before, I only fantasized of making games and when it is now a reality, I'm motivated to learn more!

## It's a beginning of a new, exciting journey
