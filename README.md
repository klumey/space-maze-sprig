### About game
You are an alien flying through space mazes! Space is filled with all types of dangers, don't fall into black holes or step into rips in space and time!
Try to escape those so you can get to the planet. 
After landing, you're job is to abduct cows! Only after getting all of them, you can fly away on your space ship. 
But beware! You start getting hungry - eat apples to finish your job and not starve!

This game has 36 levels, every one is different and difficulty differs a lot between them. 

Have fun!


## Something about the process of making this game
During the process of creating this game, I learnt a lot of new things. It is my first time coding in JS, and I'm no programming expert (only used to code some algorithms in C++).
Making all of this has been and will be a lot of fun and a great experience for me. 
All images/sprites used are made fully by me! 
To be honest, I'm really happy with the outcome and excited to call it mine. Before, I only fantasized of making games and when it is now a reality, I'm motivated to learn more!

### It's a beginning of a new, exciting journey
